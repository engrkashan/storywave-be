1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
In a quiet village, where the night sky often seemed empty and gray, lived a painter named Eli.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,000
But Eli wasn't like other artists.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,840
He didn't paint on canvases.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,720
He painted on the sky.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:18,080
Every evening, as the world slept, he climbed the highest hill with his brushes and paints and began his work.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:26,360
With gentle strokes, he dipped into pots of starlight, painting shimmering constellations and glowing galaxies across the darkness.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,680
Villagers would wake to find new patterns of stars, each telling a story.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:37,040
A fox chasing its tail, a ship sailing across the heavens, a lone tree standing against the wind.

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:44,360
Children whispered that if you stared long enough, Eli's stars would inspire dreams so vivid you could almost step into them.

10
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,240
Even weary travelers found hope in his sky, believing in magic again.

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,880
One night, after painting a cascade of golden stars, Eli paused to watch his creation.

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,840
For a moment, he realized the true beauty of his art.

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,000
It wasn't just the stars, but the dreams they sparked in hearts below.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,040
And with a contented sigh, he dipped his brush into silver once more, ready to paint tomorrow.
